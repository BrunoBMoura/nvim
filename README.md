# Neovim

This repository contains my personal configuration for Neovim. It is not a complete distribution and nor it is intended to be. It is just a set of easy to use and expand
configurations that I use in my daily work. Works on Neovim 0.8 and above.

## Dependencies tracking

Independently of your distribution, you will need to install `ripgrep`, `npm` and `tree-sitter` to ensure that this configuration works as expected with all of its plugins.

Also, a patched font, such as [https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/] is recommended to allow full visibility of the icons used in many of the configured plugins.
